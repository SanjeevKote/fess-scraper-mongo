Title: We’re All Influencers Now
Publication Date: 2024-05-01

I began my career in magazines in the pre-influencer era. As editors, we spent most of our time choosing and shaping articles for each edition, and just sort of hoped the ideas would find their way to our readers. We still do the curating and editing, of course, but we now spend considerable time trying to garner attention for what we’re publishing. Much of that happens on social media.
